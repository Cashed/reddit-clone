Runnit
======

[Live site](http://reddit-clone.surge.sh/)

Runnit is a Reddit clone app built on AngularJS. I had been playing a lot of Shadowrun on the SNES while going through the Angular curriculum and I fell in love with how much work went into building the world within the game.  This is my homage.

As one of the first complete apps built while studying Angular, it has gone through many iterations, first starting with a single controller, service, and html page.  

As I continue to gain further skills in the Angular framework, my goal is to turn this app into a complete full-stack application with a back-end database for hosting posts and users.

Thoughts/Concerns/Challenges
=================
+ Not decided on a back-end, Mongo or postgreSQL
+ Would like to move forward being mobile friendly, need to tighten up html/bootstrap
+ Selecting a song feels clunky
  + A secondary menu that slides out?
